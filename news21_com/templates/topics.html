            <h1>Changing America: Summer Reporting Projects in Development</h1>

            <h4>Demographically, culturally, politically, geographically, technologically. The United States is evolving in many ways, through its people, institutions, policies and cultures. This summer News21 fellows are exploring a wide range of topics, looking to present their investigative journalism in fresh ways with innovative approaches. Take an early look at some of the topics under development.</h4>

            <h2>Arizona State: Latino America</h2>

            <h4>The <a href="http://ning.news21.com/page/syllabus-transborder-seminar">Carnegie Transborder Seminar</a> focused on multidisciplinary study of issues relevant to the American Southwest and Latino migration patterns and cultural issues.</h4>

            <p>The <a href="http://asu.news21.com/">projects under development</a> incorporate aspects of economics, immigration policy,  Latino and U.S. politics, urban issues, demographics, education, health and religion.</p>

            <h2>Berkeley: Urban Demographics and the American Tapestry</h2>

       
            <h4>An interdisciplinary seminar called <a href="http://news21.ning.com/page/syllabus-1">Metropolis</a> forms the basis of this project.</h4>

            <p>Elements in this project center around <!-- a href="http://berkeley.news21.com" -->a key intersection<!-- /a --> in Oakland’s Temescal neighborhood, creating entries for reporting on city trends involving economics, migration and immigration, education, transportation and environment. The reporting and storytelling on each theme will be accomplished in part through contributions from our subjects and audience. For example,  Latinos from different areas of the country may be invited to share and compare experiences.  The journalists will look for ways to use cell phone technology to increase the number of people who can participate and to take advantage of GPS coordinates imbedded in cell phone photos for mapping purposes. Another goal is to try to develop an interface for a subset of the ANES Time Series data that will allow members of the public to search it and, through an external site like ManyEyes, create their own graphics to post on Berkeley's Web site.

            <h2>Columbia: The Charter Explosion</h2>

       
            <h4>The stories tied to this project stem from a <a href="http://coveringeducation.org/syllabus.html">specialty reporting class on education</a> that included a <a href="http://coveringeducation.org/schoolstories09/">stand-alone Web site</a>.</h4>

            <p>The fellows from Columbia are examining <!-- a href="http://columbia.news21.com" -->American education issues through the lens of charter schools<!-- /a--> in places like NY, New Orleans, Minneapolis, Michigan and the nation's capital. Their reporting explores the marketplace of hybrid schools designed along racial, ethnic, language, gender, religious and spiritual lines.</p>

            <h2>Maryland: The New Voters</h2>

       
            <h4>News 21 fellows participated in the <a href="http://ning.news21.com/profiles/blogs/research-seminar-syllabus">Carnegie research seminar</a>, which concentrated on demographic, attitudinal and political shifts that may have contributed to the election of the nation’s first African-American president.</h4>

          <p><a href="http://umd.news21.com">The Maryland journalism project</a> concentrates on a central question: How do historical trends portend emerging patterns in racial and ethnic political influence in the United States? In the strongest showing of minority voting power in history, Latinos in record numbers joined African-Americans to help elect the nation’s first non-white president.  Yet the election also set another, less-noted record: An unprecedented number of voting age Latinos stayed home. Both records reflect the fact that Latinos are the nation’s fastest growing population, one with tremendous, unrealized potential to exert game-changing influence over the country’s direction.  Maryland’s project will offer a richly nuanced look at Latinos’ emerging role in national and local politics. The in-depth examination will include analysis of new exit-polling data; identifying and visiting hotspots; and engaging voters and potential voters in a dialogue with us and each other about their political future. Maryland reporters will dive deep into the internal and external forces that predict whether and how Latinos engage in the political process.  </p>

            <h4>Via a <a href="http://ning.news21.com/page/medill-seminar-syllabus">seminar in audience insights</a>, fellows from Northwestern's Medill School focused on individuals and urban identities.</h4>

            <p>Reporting from Northwestern seeks to summarize a range of <!-- a href="http://northwestern.news21.com" -->perspectives of young Americans<!--/a -->, ages 21-34, in metropolitan areas. The fellows will probe their views, concerns, hopes and priorities. Multimedia  teams will chronicle the American present that these young people inhabit and the future they anticipate, capturing their voices and creating journalism that is meaningful to them. Fellows will examine the way this generation forms communities, how they self-identify, the issues that matter to them and their visions of their country and their future.

            <h4>USC's  <a href="http://ning.news21.com/page/usc-syllabus-southwestern">"New Communities and New Realities" seminar</a> concentrated on fundamental demographic shifts in the American Southwest and the Mountain West and the resulting political, economic, cultural and social implications.</h4>

            <p>General historic trends of demographic change in the United States foretell current immigration patterns into and within the United States. The fellows from USC's Annenberg School will <!-- a href="http://usc.news21.com" -->investigate changing social dynamics and relations<!-- /a --> among newer and older communities in the Southwest.

            <p>Syracuse students will examine <!-- a href="http://syracuse.news21.com" -->how technology affects young people's relationships<!--/a --> with friends, family, institutions, education, etc., by visiting <a href="11%20Patchwork%20Nation%20communities" onclick="return (false);">11 Patchwork Nation communities</a>: Eagle, Colo. (boom town); Ann Arbor, Mich. (campus and career town); Clermont, Fla. (empty nest); Nixa, Mo. (evangelical epicenter); El Mirage (immigrant nation); Philadelphia (industrial metropolis); Hopkinsville, Ky. (military bastion); Baton Rouge, La. (minority central); Los Alamos, N.M. (monied ‘burbs); Lincoln City, Ore. (service worker center); Sioux City, Iowa (tractor country). Blogs for each community are available at <a href="http://youngandthewireless.com/blog/">TheYoungAndTheWireless.com</a>. The goal is to explore a direct question: What is the residents’ relationship with technology itself?</p>
