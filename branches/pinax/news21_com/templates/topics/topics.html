            <h1>Changing America: Summer Reporting Projects in Development</h1>

            <h4>Demographically, culturally, politically, geographically, technologically. The United States is evolving in many ways, through its people, institutions, policies and cultures. This summer News21 fellows are exploring a wide range of topics, looking to present their investigative journalism in fresh ways with innovative approaches. Take an early look at some of the topics under development.</h4>

            <h2>Berkeley: Urban Demographics and the American Tapestry</h2>

       
            <h4>An interdisciplinary seminar called <a href="http://news21.ning.com/page/syllabus-1">Metropolis</a> forms the basis of this project.</h4>

            <p>Elements in this project center around <a href="http://berkeley.news21.com">a key intersection</a> in Oakland’s Temescal neighborhood, creating entries for reporting on city trends involving economics, migration and immigration, education, transportation and environment. The reporting and storytelling on each theme will be accomplished in part through contributions from our subjects and audience. For example,  Latinos from different areas of the country may be invited to share and compare experiences.  The journalists will look for ways to use cell phone technology to increase the number of people who can participate and to take advantage of GPS coordinates imbedded in cell phone photos for mapping purposes. Another goal is to try to develop an interface for a subset of the ANES Time Series data that will allow members of the public to search it and, through an external site like ManyEyes, create their own graphics to post on Berkeley's Web site.

            </p>

<p>
<ul>
    <li>These four sites are designed to demonstrate a fresh approach to reporting and presentation of local news.  Think of them as portals, each with a widening focus as we shift from street corner, to transit hub, to suburbs and exurbs and finally, to an innovative tool for sharing hard-to-find data about cities all over the Bay Area. Our hope is to enrich the detail and depth of local reporting across the country by encouraging journalists, particularly freelancers and hyper-local websites, to pick up where we left off and especially, to <a href="http://berkeley.news21.com/">STEAL OUR STUFF</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="http://berkeley.news21.com/51/">51st and Telegraph</a> - What would happen if we took both a macro- and microscopic look at this intersection, and mashed the two together. Could we dig into the tiny details -- like the story of one single tree -- and probe the larger questions -- like an investigation into rapid development -- and then find some visually interesting way to stitch our discoveries together? We started to suspect that by looking deeply at a single intersection, we could start to tell the story of the city as a whole.</li>
    <li>We decided to create a fully immersive experience: a 360-degree, interactive entry-point that would bring 51st and Telegraph to life. This led us to two great applications: PTGui, a photo stitching program, and Flash Panorama Player, which creates 360-degree panoramas that are as interactive or as simple as you want. We'd seen great panoramas used for journalism before, like the Places We Live project and We're All Going to Die, but nothing as "clickable" as the one we developed. To help locate stories, we set up a blog where residents who passed through our intersection could post text messages telling us precisely what they were doing "right now at 51st and Telegraph."</li>
    <li><a href="http://berkeley.news21.com/barthood/">BARThood</a> - The project examines who BART is serving by visualizing demographic data of ridership by station, aggregating content and news about each BARThood, and highlighting select BARThoods with in-depth reporting on individuals who know their BARThood best. We leveraged pre-built components and customized them to rapidly develop interactive charts and graphs, allowing us to give life to a data- rich, but otherwise dull, government report.  The site features a slide show of Creative Commons licensed images from Flickr specific to each station as well as a custom feed, built with Yahoo Pipes, to combine up-tp-the minute Google blogs, GoogleNews, Twitter and Yelp posts sepcific to each station. These features keep the site fresh and constantly updated. </li>
    <li><a href="http://berkeley.news21.com/town-square/">The New Town Square</a> - At its broadest level, the New Town Square  project  explores  modern notions of community in a world  where populations are increasingly mobile, local news is disappearing  and the American downtown  has faded to memory. More specifically, it questions how this concept of community is preserved, redefined or lost in three Northern California towns that experienced rapid population growth in the 1990s and 2000s due to an influx of commuters from Bay Area cities. Beyond telling the story of the death of small town America, this site begins to define what comes after this decline. Its multi-media applications are meant to help residents better understand one another, their collective histories and present experiences, as well as to present a glimpse of a broader new American reality.  The introductory video combines a very old film technique with modern digital tools to give new urgency to a well-known tale of change.  </li>
    <li><a href="http://berkeley.news21.com/citylab/">CityLab</a> - CityLab is a database created by and for reporters.  Aimed at assisting time and resource-strapped newsrooms, CityLab  currently collects and displays demographic data about 65 cities throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. It has been designed as a working prototype for a nationwide city database that will allow reporters to compare important, but hard-to-find information about cities all over the country. Our hope is to enrich the detail and depth of local reporting across the country by encouraging journalists, especially free-lancers and hyper-local websites, to collaborate in an on-line community that is both open-sourced and closely vetted.  Each of the thousands of data points in CityLab is individually sourced, allowing reporters to fact-check on their own by visiting the website from which the data was pulled, or by directly contacting the reporter who contributed the data. To illustrate how CityLab could be used to tell new and interesting stories, the web site will feature original written and multimedia stories as well as a constantly updating marquee of interesting facts.</li>

            <h2>Columbia: The Charter Explosion</h2>

       
            <h4>The stories tied to this project stem from a <a href="http://coveringeducation.org/syllabus.html">specialty reporting class on education</a> that included a <a href="http://coveringeducation.org/schoolstories09/">stand-alone Web site</a>.</h4>

            <p>The fellows from Columbia are examining <a href="http://columbia.news21.com">American education issues through the lens of charter schools</a> in places like NY, New Orleans, Minneapolis, Michigan and the nation's capital. Their reporting explores the marketplace of hybrid schools designed along racial, ethnic, language, gender, religious and spiritual lines.</p>

            <h4>News 21 fellows participated in the <a href="http://ning.news21.com/profiles/blogs/research-seminar-syllabus">Carnegie research seminar</a>, which concentrated on demographic, attitudinal and political shifts that may have contributed to the election of the nation’s first African-American president.</h4>

          <p><a href="http://www.thenewvoters.com">The Maryland journalism project</a> concentrates on a central question: How do historical trends portend emerging patterns in racial and ethnic political influence in the United States? In the strongest showing of minority voting power in history, Latinos in record numbers joined African-Americans to help elect the nation’s first non-white president.  Yet the election also set another, less-noted record: An unprecedented number of voting age Latinos stayed home. Both records reflect the fact that Latinos are the nation’s fastest growing population, one with tremendous, unrealized potential to exert game-changing influence over the country’s direction.  Maryland’s project will offer a richly nuanced look at Latinos’ emerging role in national and local politics. The in-depth examination will include analysis of new exit-polling data; identifying and visiting hotspots; and engaging voters and potential voters in a dialogue with us and each other about their political future. Maryland reporters will dive deep into the internal and external forces that predict whether and how Latinos engage in the political process.  </p>

            <p>Syracuse students will examine <a href="http://syracuse.news21.com">how technology affects young people's relationships</a> with friends, family, institutions, education, etc., by visiting <a href="11%20Patchwork%20Nation%20communities" onclick="return (false);">11 Patchwork Nation communities</a>: Eagle, Colo. (boom town); Ann Arbor, Mich. (campus and career town); Clermont, Fla. (empty nest); Nixa, Mo. (evangelical epicenter); El Mirage (immigrant nation); Philadelphia (industrial metropolis); Hopkinsville, Ky. (military bastion); Baton Rouge, La. (minority central); Los Alamos, N.M. (monied ‘burbs); Lincoln City, Ore. (service worker center); Sioux City, Iowa (tractor country). Blogs for each community are available at <a href="http://youngandthewireless.com/blog/">TheYoungAndTheWireless.com</a>. The goal is to explore a direct question: What is the residents’ relationship with technology itself?</p>
