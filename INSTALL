=Setup working dir with virtualenv=
easy_install virtualenv
mkdir dev && cd dev
virtualenv newsroom-env
source newsroom-env/bin/activate

=Get pip=
easy_intall pip 
# or download from pypi and run python setup.py install

=Get the code=

==use your virtualenv==

cd newsroom-env

==checkout the project==

If you want to get writeable access to svn you have to be a project member and request that through the group.  If you are already a group member, use this command:

svn checkout https://django-newsroom.googlecode.com/svn working

==get the external app modules==

cd working/trunk
pip install -r requirements/external_apps.txt

==Caveats==

If you only want read-only access use this:

svn checkout http://django-newsroom.googlecode.com/svn working

You may want to checkout just part of the tree, in which case you might use something like, appending a subdirectory to the svn path:

svn checkout http://django-newsroom.googlecode.com/svn/trunk working
