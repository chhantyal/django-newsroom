=Setup working dir with virtualenv=

easy_install virtualenv
mkdir dev && cd dev
virtualenv newsroom-env
source newsroom-env/bin/activate

=Get pip=
easy_install pip 
# or download from pypi and run python setup.py install

=Get the code=

==use your virtualenv==

cd newsroom-env

==checkout the project==

If you want to get writeable access to svn you have to be a project member and request that through the group.  If you are already a group member, use this command:

svn checkout https://django-newsroom.googlecode.com/svn working

==get the external app modules==

cd working/trunk
pip install -r requirements/external_apps.txt

==done==

cd newsroom
./manage.py syncdb
./manage.py runserver

=Caveats=

If you only want read-only access use this:

svn checkout http://django-newsroom.googlecode.com/svn working

You may want to checkout just part of the tree, in which case you might use something like, appending a subdirectory to the svn path:

svn checkout http://django-newsroom.googlecode.com/svn/trunk working

==PIL==

Installing PIL with pip failed for us on OSX, we needed to download the source
and use the setup.py.  http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

wget http://effbot.org/downloads/Imaging-1.1.6.tar.gz
tar zxf Imaging-1.1.6.tar.gz
cd Imaging-1.1.6
python setup.py install

==django-countries==

For some reason this project doesn't have a setup.py, so you have to handle it
manually.

cd newsroom/apps/
svn co http://django-countries.googlecode.com/svn/trunk django-countries
ln -s django-countries/countries .

==photologue==

photologue 3 is still bleeding edge, but we're going to fly with it.

cd newsroom/apps/
svn co http://django-photologue.googlecode.com/svn/branches/3.x/ photologue-3.x
ln -s photologue-3.x/photologue .
