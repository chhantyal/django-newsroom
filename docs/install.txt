==========================
Installing django-newsroom
==========================

Setup working dir with virtualenv
---------------------------------

easy_install virtualenv

mkdir dev && cd dev

virtualenv newsroom-env

source newsroom-env/bin/activate

cd newsroom-env


Get pip
-------

easy_install pip

# or grab tarball at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip and run python setup.py install


Get the code
------------

checkout the project 
---------------------

svn checkout http://django-newsroom.googlecode.com/svn working


check out the project (with write access)
------------------------------------------------

If you want to get writeable access to svn you have to be a project member and request that through the group. (notice https)

svn checkout https://django-newsroom.googlecode.com/svn working

You also may want to checkout using just part of the tree, in which case you might use something like, appending a subdirectory to the svn path:

svn checkout http://django-newsroom.googlecode.com/svn/trunk working


get the external app modules
----------------------------

pip install -r working/trunk/requirements/external_apps.txt


done with dependencies, run the dev server
------------------------------------------

cd working/trunk/newsroom

./manage.py syncdb

./manage.py runserver


Caveats
-------


PIL
---

Installing PIL with pip failed for us on OSX, we needed to download the source and use the setup.py. http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

wget http://effbot.org/downloads/Imaging-1.1.6.tar.gz

tar zxf Imaging-1.1.6.tar.gz

cd Imaging-1.1.6

python setup.py install

django-countries
----------------

For some reason this project doesn't have a setup.py, so you have to handle it manually.

cd newsroom/apps/

svn co http://django-countries.googlecode.com/svn/trunk django-countries

ln -s django-countries/countries .

photologue
----------

photologue 3 is still bleeding edge, but we're going to fly with it.

cd newsroom/apps/

svn co http://django-photologue.googlecode.com/svn/branches/3.x/ photologue-3.x

ln -s photologue-3.x/photologue .
