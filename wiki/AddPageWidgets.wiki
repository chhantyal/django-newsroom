#How to enable page widgets

= Introduction =

This page will describe how to add page widgets to the page editor, in order to enable the editing interface.


= Details =

Page widgets are a set of predefined html tied with javascript to enable dynamic edition of html content. Page widgets rely heavily on javascript/ajax to work, and it's relatively easy to add new ones.

In order to create a new page widget, markup must be defined. Here is the example of the image widget:
{{{
<div class="widget-block widget-image-block">
    <img width="100%" height="300" src=""/>
</div>
}}}

The magic here is in the class attribute for the the div. By specifying "widget-image-block" we are enabling specific behaviour to occur for these type of "objects".
In order to enable an editing interface for the widget, two files are needed:
  * pages.js
  * widget.class.js
