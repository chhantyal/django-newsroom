=Describe your project=
(58 characters remaining)

In the process of publishing content to the web, one major hurdle continues to be a recurring theme in newsrooms: Overly restrictive Content Management Systems have become a bottleneck in the work-flow, limiting the presentation of creative digital content. Journalists are dying to get their hands on a CMS that is easy to use, capable of flexing to accommodate new story structures, and practical to deploy.

Rather than relying on expensive, proprietary content management tools that are not fine-tuned for the art of digital storytelling, journalists should be building their own software tools, which can then be released to the public and shared between organizations. But journalists are writers, not programmers. They emerge from liberal arts backgrounds, and often consider the art of storytelling to be the ultimate skill set. But a digital revolution has moved the readership online, and publishing models for telling those stories have changed drastically. 

Generally speaking, journalists are no more adept at online publishing than the average !MySpace user. That's why we want to create a software solution for news organizations to easily publish new media online -- to give journalists a venue for telling their stories that is simple to learn and use. We plan to: 

 # Create a simple, pre-packaged, auto-install content management system for news organizations that is built specifically for journalists to tell stories online. 
 # Release public source code in order to encourage development participation by the same community of journalists and developers who will be using the system.  
 # Develop a software community whose sole purpose would be to maintain the software and update it regularly to keep it secure and relevant. 

By the end of eight months, we plan to have a fully functioning beta version, and in one year a final product.  

=How will your project improve the way news and information are delivered to geographic communities?=

Walk into most newsrooms, and you’ll find and that the reporters, editors and photographers  have little understanding of how their stories or photos end up on the web.  The technical maintenance of publication sites is often outsourced to external companies, which may or may not themselves practice journalism. This happens because the complexity of the CMS is so great that it takes specialized staff to run it.

This is especially apparent in small newsrooms serving local communities, who will be our target audience. As newspaper subscriptions decline, so do the organizations that serve local communities. Our goal is to help the thousands of mid-market news organizations that simply won't survive in the coming years as their print costs rise and ad revenues decline.

=How is your idea innovative? (new or different from what already exists)=

(4 characters remaining)  

We want to create the next !WordPress or Drupal – but built on a framework that is modular and innovative. WordPress is simple and easy to use, but is built for blogs and simple publications - it was never designed for the complex site structures journalism requires. Drupal is powerful, but has a steep learning curve and is often frustrating to customize. Django Newsroom is different in three ways: It's simple, it's flexible, and it's made for journalists, with the input of journalists.

Unlike almost systems, ours will be built with multimedia in mind. We will implement the latest technologies for running video, audio and photo slideshows. It will be pre-packaged with a basic player, but allow for modification and branding. We will also include support for streaming services (served by 3rd parties) to live-broadcast events.


=What experience do you or your organization have to successfully develop this project?=
(400 characters remaining)

Whenever there is a plan to do something highly ambitious with digital tools, there is usually a hole in the team's skill set. Either there is a lack of technical expertise, or the team that is too technical and doesn't appreciate the needs of the everyday user. We've assembled a team that is diverse in its backgrounds and contains the  right combination of skills to make this project a reality.

Team leader Milan Andric is technically proficient in just this way. He is a programmer who spent the last three years working for the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.  He also developed a CMS from the ground up. Built purely in PHP, it was a tremendous learning experience as he realized the evolving needs of journalists required consistent re-thinking of the what the system is and does. Along the way he discovered a new mechanism for building CMSes -- Django. He later built a CMS in Django to serve the site for the Knight Digtial Media Center at UC Berkeley, which sits on top of a complex and multi-tiered data structure. The site has gone through several revisions, all possible thanks to of the flexibility of the framework.

=What unmet need does your proposal answer?=
(11 characters remaining)  

Online newsrooms struggle with publishing systems that are difficult to change. Systems are often built for a pre-defined story format and controlled by parent corporations. Examples of story formats that newsrooms struggle to publish include Flash-based presentations, map mash-ups, custom navigation and templates for special feature presentations, data-backed presentations like chicagocrime.org or everyblock.com. There are really two obstacles to overcome: 1) Rigid and unchangeable data models on the back-end, and 2) Rigid and unchangeable presentation templates. In contrast, Django Newsroom aims to provide a platform that can accommodate any data type, where custom content types and story formats are encouraged, rather than discouraged.


=What tasks/benchmarks need to be accomplished to develop your project and by when will you complete them?=
(176 characters remaining)  

The project is currently in early planning phases, which involves defining requirements and starting the outreach process.  During the “requirements phase” of development, our first objective is to research and discuss what the needs of journalists are, and to formulate the requirements for the components of the software. Once that phase is complete, we’ll create a roadmap defining our path to the first milestone release and final goals.  The requirements phase requires discussion and input from all sides: developers, interaction and interface designers,  and particularly journalists who are technically inclined, to craft, define and prioritize features. 

Software construction is a multi-disciplinary activity, so we need to encourage professionals from all areas of the ecosystem to participate. CMSes built by engineers in a vacuum is the problem; we intend not to repeat that mistake.  It is important to find people who see value in the project and encourage them to participate in the open source process.  

"Release early, release often" is a tried-and-true open source mantra. When software is made available early, user interest grows, participants come on board, and feedback is gathered sooner rather than later. A positive and continuous feedback loop will be critical to the project's success.

Our first release will include a web-based slideshow and video application.  These applications are in very high demand, and are particularly needed in multimedia journalism.  We hope to have a release for these applications ready in a month.

When any software is released, it is important to have a demonstration site, so potential users can kick the tires and begin the feedback loop.  The demo site will be running the current/development version of our software. This provides a place for anyone to test new features without installing anything.  

We have already launched an open discussion group for the project, and participants are actively chewing on ideas and approaches for Django Newsroom.  

=What will you have changed by the end of your project?=
(1532 characters remaining)  

As the iterative development process progresses, we expect to go through many iterations of sample data models, back-end interfaces, and workflow approaches. Because of the anticipated difficulty of getting this right, we don’t expect it to be perfect the first time. 

=How will you measure progress and ultimately success?=
(546 characters remaining)  

Progress will be measured in milestones and release cycles.  We plan to have a regular release cycle in which a new version of the software will be made available every 3 months.  Each release will address a defined set of objectives, and the team will work towards those goals for each release.  Success will be measured by answering these questions (in rough chronological order):


 * How many people join our discussion group?
 * How many messages are sent in our discussion group?
 * How many views does the demo site get?
 * How many views does the project web site get?
 * Are any major publications linking to or talking about us?
 * How many people actually downloaded the software?
 * How many developers have commit access to the software repository?
 * How many organizations are involved in development of our project?
 * How many organizations are using our software in a production environment?
 * What kind of feedback are we getting from deploying organizations? 
 * Are organizations contributing patches and code back to the project?


=Do you see any risk in the development of your project?=
(1246 characters remaining)  

The only risk is that another project with similar goals might gain more interest than we do.  This might divide the resources/people available to contribute to our project. Because it’s relatively difficult for an organization to “escape” from a content management system, once a publication decides on a competing product, it could be difficult to win them back (even if our platform is markedly superior). Therefore it is in the best interest of Django Newsroom to get a working platform “into the wild” sooner rather than later.


=What is your marketing plan? How will people learn about what you are doing?=
