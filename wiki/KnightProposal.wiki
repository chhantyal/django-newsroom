Project Title:Django Newsroom

Requested amount from Knight News Challenge:350,000

Expected amount of time to complete project:1

Total cost of project including all sources of funding:350,000

Describe your project:

Journalism should be building our own software tools that are released to the public. But journalists are writers, not programmers. They come from liberal arts backgrounds and pronounce the art of story telling as the end-all-be-all skill set to reaching the hearts and minds of the public. But a digital revolution has moved that "public" online, and publishing models for telling those stories have changed drastically. Generally speaking, journalists are no more adept at online publishing than the average MySpace user. That's why we want to create a software solution for news organizations to easily publish media online -- to give journalists a venue for telling their stories that is incredibly simple to use; and we have the technical expertise to do it. This solution would be to create a completely open-source and free Web application for any news organization to utilize. We plan to: 1) Create a simple, packaged, auto-install content management system for news organizations that is built specifically for journalists to tell stories online. 2) Release a public source code to engage the community to participate in improving the system to evolve with the changing needs of the industry. 3) Develop a software community whose sole purpose would be to maintain the software and update it regularly to keep it secure and relevant. We would create this software product in one-year's time. By eight months, we plan to have a fully functioning beta version, and in one year a final product.

How will your project improve the way news and information are delivered to geographic communities?

Walk into most newsrooms across this country and the reporters, editors and photographers probably have no idea how their stories or photos end up on the Web. The Web sites are a separate entity, sometimes even outsourced to a tech company that normally specializes in e-commerce. They do this for good reasons; the complexity of the CMS is so great it takes specialized staff to even make it run. This is especially apparent in small newsrooms serving local communities. This will be our target audience. As newspaper subscriptions decline, so do the organizations that serve local communities. We're doing this to help all of the thousands of mid-market news organizations that simply won't survive in the coming years as their print costs rise.

How is your idea innovative? (new or different from what already exists)

Various "simple" publishing platforms already exist. WordPress is easy to use, but is built for blogging. It is astounding how many people attempt to use WordPress as a content management system. Why? Because it's simple. But it was never made for that purpose and the result is a bail awired hacked CMS to do something it was never intended to do. We want to create the next WordPress or Drupal â€“ but built on a framework that is modular and innovative. How is ours different? Three ways: It's simple, it's flexible and it's made for journalists, with the input of journalists. Our system will utilize an emerging technology that already exists: the Python-based Django framework. It provides the building blocks to construct a well designed CMS.

What experience do you or your organization have to successfully develop this project?

This team will have the perfect combination of skills. Whenever there is a plan to do something incredible with digital tools, there is usually a hole in the team's skill set. Either there is a lack of technical expertise, or it's a team that is too technical and doesn't speak to the needs of the everyday user. We believe we have a team that is diverse in its backgrounds and contains the combination of skills to make this project a reality. The team leader, Milan Andric, is technically proficient in just this way. He is a programmer who spent the last three years working for the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism developing a CMS from the ground up. Built purely in PHP, it was a tremendous learning experience as he realized the evolving needs of journalists required consistent rebuilds of the system. That's when he discovered a new mechanism for building CMSs -- Django. He later built a CMS in Django to serve the site for the Knight Digital Media Center at UC Berkeley. The site has gone through several revisions, all possible because of the flexibility of the framework.
