=Describe your project=

In the process of getting content on the Web, one major hurdle continues to be a reoccurring theme among virtually every newsroom we talk to. The Content Management      System has become the new copy desk, and everyone is dying to get their hands on something that is easy, capable and practical.

Rather than relying on expensive, proprietary content management tools that are not fine-tuned for the art of digital storytelling, journalists should be building their own software tools, which can then be released to the public and shared between organizations. But journalists are writers, not programmers. They emerge from liberal arts backgrounds, and often consider the art of storytelling to be the ultimate skill set. But a digital revolution has moved the readership online, and publishing models for telling those stories have changed drastically. 

Generally speaking, journalists are no more adept at online publishing than the average MySpace user. That's why we want to create a software solution for news organizations to easily publish new media online -- to give journalists a venue for telling their stories that is simple to learn and use. We plan to create an open-source and free Web application for any news organization to utilize. We plan to: 

 # Create a simple, packaged, auto-install content management system for news organizations that is built specifically for journalists to tell stories online. 
 # Release a public source code to engage the community to participate in improving the system to evolve with the changing needs of the industry. 
 # Develop a software community whose sole purpose would be to maintain the software and update it regularly to keep it secure and relevant. 

We can create this software product in one-year's time. By the end of eight months, we plan to have a fully functioning beta version, and in one year a final product.  

=How will your project improve the way news and information are delivered to geographic communities?=

Walk into most newsrooms across this country, you’ll find and that the reporters, editors and photographers probably have little understanding of how their stories or photos end up on the Web.  The publication web sites are a separate entity, sometimes even outsourced to a tech company that normally often specializes in e-commerce. They do this for good reasons; the complexity of the CMS is so great it takes specialized staff to even keep it running. 

This is especially apparent in small newsrooms serving local communities, who will be our target audience. As newspaper subscriptions decline, so do the organizations that serve local communities. Our goal is to help all of the thousands of mid-market news organizations that simply won't survive in the coming years as their print costs rise and ad revenues decline. 

=How is your idea innovative? (new or different from what already exists)=

Various "simple" publishing platforms already exist. WordPress is easy to use, but is built for confined data structures such as blogs and simple publications. It is astounding how many people attempt to use WordPress as a content management system. Why? WordPress is popular because it's simple, but it was never designed for the more complex site structures, and the result is a bail-wired hacked CMS to do something it was never intended to do.

We want to create the next WordPress or Drupal – but built on a framework that is modular and innovative. How is ours different? Three ways: It's simple, it's flexible and it's made for journalists, with the input of journalists.

Our system will utilize an emerging technology that already exists: the Python-based Django framework. Rather than yet another pre-fab CMS with all of its assumptions and limitations, Django provides the building blocks to construct a well designed CMS custom-tailored to the needs of new media journalists. 

Unlike almost every other system, ours will be built with multimedia in mind. We will implement the latest technologies for running Flash video, audio and photo slideshows. It will be pre-packaged with a basic player, but allow for modification and branding. We will also include support for streaming services (severd by 3rd parties) to live broadcast events.

WordPress and Drupal have vibrant communities and support centers, despite being free solutions.  We plan to create a similar community around our Django package. We will first develop a Web site to facilitate that community and gather developers for managing the project. Builds will be distributed via this site, and input and support will be included through the use of forums and wikis.

=What experience do you or your organization have to successfully develop this project?=


This team will have the perfect combination of skills. Whenever there is a plan to do something incredible with digital tools, there is usually a hole in the team's skill set. Either there is a lack of technical expertise, or it's a team that is too technical and doesn't speak to the needs of the everyday user. We believe we have a team that is diverse in its backgrounds and contains the combination of skills to make this a reality.

The team leader, Milan Andric, is technically proficient in just this way. He is a programmer who spent the last three years working for the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.  He also developed a CMS from the ground up. Built purely in PHP, it was a tremendous learning experience as he realized the evolving needs of journalists required consistent rebuilds of the system. That's when he discovered a new mechanism for building CMSes -- the Python-based Django framework. He later built a CMS in Django to serve the site for the Knight Digtial Media Center at UC Berkeley. The site has gone through several revisions, all possible because of the flexibility of the framework.
