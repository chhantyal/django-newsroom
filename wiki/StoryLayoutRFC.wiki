#summary Strategies to handle multiple layouts in story pages

= Introduction =

Stories are composed of pages and these pages will contain layout information to define how the page is rendered.  At the time of this writing this layout feature only relates to the stories module.

= Backend Templates =

For example, on the backend we start by defining the following templates for a page:

{{{
stories/page_detail_one_column.html
stories/page_detail_two_column.html
stories/page_detail_three_column.html
}}}

Each of these template will have the required html and css associated with them to create a layout structure for a specific page.  

= Column Breaks =

The interface to define what layout you would like to use is defined by using column break tags.  So within your page if you want a new column you define a column break, like:

{{{
<!-- column break -->
}}}

The page view will parse the page content and depending on how many column breaks exist will choose the appropriate base template for rendering.  If there are more than the supported column breaks in a page body the parser will raise an except or ignore it (TODO).

= Grids =

Each of the supported backend templates will be based on a grid layout, like [http://960.gs/ 960.gs].  A  photoshop document or image with the grid structure will be provided.  The grid template can be used to mockup your page in photoshop or on paper, as well as providing you with pixel dimensions for your media within the templates.  

This should be sufficient for the authors to plan their story layout and have a complete idea of story layout before approaching the CMS with their final and vetted media.
