#summary Django Newsroom Sections RFC

= Introduction =

== Sections ==

Sections are top level collection of stories groped by topic.  For instance, a section on the site related to the Housing Crisis could list stories based on the following more general topics “housing,” “banking,” “mortgages” and that would live under the site at 
{{{
http://news21.com/economy/housing-crisis/.
}}}

This RFC helps to define how this section is dynamically created and structured under the hood.

== Section Paths ==

Section paths are free-from strings defined by (editors/authors?) which allow you to  navigate / categorize content.  They follow the convention of:

{{{
/people/george_bush/
/places/europe/france/region/paris/neighborhood
/topics/immigration
/events/2009/inauguration
}}}

= Sections manager =
