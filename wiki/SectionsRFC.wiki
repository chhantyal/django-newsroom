#summary Django Newsroom Sections RFC

= Introduction =

== Sections ==

Sections are top level collection of stories groped by topic.  For instance, a section on the site related to the Housing Crisis could list stories based on the following more general topics “housing,” “banking,” “mortgages” and that would live under the site at 
{{{
http://news21.com/economy/housing-crisis/
}}}

This RFC helps to define how this section is dynamically created and structured under the hood.

== Section Paths ==

Section Paths are a term we are creating to describe free-from strings defined by editors or authors that allow you to categorize content.  The strings follow a simple convention using forward slashes:

{{{
/people/george_bush/
/places/europe/france/region/paris/neighborhood
/topics/immigration
/events/2009/inauguration
}}}


= Sections Editor =

The Sections Editor provides an interface for creating new Section Paths and Sections. 

= Schema =

{{{
sections (n) ---- (n) section_path (n) ---- (n) stories
}}}

= Models =


= Templates =

{{{
{% for get_stories_by_section economy/housing-crisis as story %}
}}}

= Stories Example =

In this example a screen provides you with a list of checkboxes to relate a story to one or more Section Paths.
